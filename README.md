# Autonomous-Path-Planning-Bot
In this project the bot position and orientation is determined by image processing. Knowing position and orientation, the bot is then guided to its destination. The project is divided into, (1) Machine Vision (2) Electronics Circuit. Machine vision is prime component of the project. Here the image processing is done using MATLAB software. Machine vision is used to determine the position and orientation of bot as well as real time location with respect to destination. Electronics Circuit is based on open source environment Arduino Uno which is interfaced with Bluetooth module and servo motor. Entire botâ€™s mobility and sweeping function using servo motor is controlled by programming done in the arduino IDE
